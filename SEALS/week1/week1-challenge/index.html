        <p>I chose a tree to represent my creativity because, like a tree, my creativity grows as it is fed. My creativity expands and changes as I experience more in life and learn. One day I hope that my creativity grows to be as great as a redwood. I'll just have to see what happens as I continue to keep on living my life.</p>

   <p>This past saturday we went ove the basics of HTML5. I rememebr some of it from, like the different tags and how to use a full link as an image source, but it was nice to go over the things I had fprgotten. For example, I didn't really remeber how to properly create an html file in a folder, the fact HTML stands for Hypertect Markup Language, or how to use the basic console comands. Besides just code, we also interviewd some of the pas seals, and got a feel for what is expected of us and how we wil be challange going forward.Then, on tuesday, we were suposed to begin the class talking about the Alchemist. However, very few of us actually read it. This was disapointing but we reconciled withourselves and moved on. We then went over css. I feel like I remebered more of css than I did HTML. I knew how to do most of what we went over, like how to set up a css decloration and how to use ID's and classes, but I must admit I did forget a bit of the termonology.   </p>
